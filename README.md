## My process

My process began making all layout with HTML, then, working from top to bottom with styling for mobile layout. Next, I styled the desktop version, and finally, but not least important, I solved the mobile side menu with the hamburguer toggle. I used CSS Grid all the times even if some parts where easier to work with Flexbox. Tha idea was to practice Grid a lot.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [PicPick](https://picpick.app/en/) - Very useful tools for web development tasks, like measuring of pixels with a useful ruler for images and a very nice color picker.
- VS Code editor

### What I learned

I practiced a lot of CSS Grid laying out and styling with @media queries for mobile first and then for desktop. This was also a good practice for a React JS simple scripting project.
